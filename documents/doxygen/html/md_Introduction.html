1 Overview</h1>
<p >At the beginning of your adventure, we try to answer some questions you are likely to ask, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is Arm-2D?</li>
<li>what problems does it solve?</li>
<li>Who are the users it faces?</li>
<li>What are the parts of Arm-2D?</li>
<li>What assumptions does it make about the environment in which it is used? and</li>
<li>What are the restrictions?</li>
</ul>
<p >We hope this could help you with a wonderful journey.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md31"></a>
1.1 What is Arm-2D</h2>
<p >If you want to use a graphical interface in the Linux environment, you don’t have to face hardware such as GPU directly. In fact, the Linux ecosystem will provide you with mature software support, which includes drivers for GPU, GUI stacks and a large number of handy interface reference designs.</p>
<p >Unfortunately, if you are an embedded developer who mainly uses Cortex-M, due to the lack of a mature software system like that the Linux ecosystem has, you may have to face various non-standard LCD hardware modules directly. If you are lucky, you also need to face the non-standard 2D graphics accelerators provided by different chip manufacturers. Although you have many GUI stacks to choose from, most of them lack direct support for a specific device, and then you have to port the GUI to your own platform, solving problems between low-level hardware acceleration and high-level software. In summary, it is feasible to use GUI in the Cortex-M system, but most of the time, we need to take care of almost every detail.</p>
<p ><b>Figure 1-1 Ecosystem Comparison between Rich Embedded and Constraint Embedded System in GUI</b></p>
<p ><img src="../documents/pictures/TopReadme_1_2a.png" alt="image-20210318235815106" style="zoom: 67%;" class="inline"/></p>
<p ><b>Arm-2D is not about reinventing a GUI or competing with the existing GUI stacks.</b> In fact, the problem Arm-2D wants to solve is how to <b>provide a unified low-level hardware acceleration interface for all GUI stacks</b> so that these high-level software service providers are no longer tired of writing drivers for a large number of emerging non-standard embedded hardware platforms. Once Arm-2D becomes a tacit understanding between GUI providers and chip manufacturers, everyone can perform their duties to maximise cooperation within the entire embedded ecosystem.</p>
<p ><b>Figure 1-2 The Hierarchy of a Typical Embedded GUI System.</b></p>
<p ><img src="../documents/pictures/TopReadme_1_2b.png" alt="image-20210319001021087" style="zoom: 67%;" class="inline"/></p>
<p >To put it simple, <b>Arm-2D focuses on low level 2D image processing and provides a unified software interface for the vastly different 2D accelerators.</b></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md32"></a>
1.2 Target Audiences</h2>
<p >In the Arm-2D story, there are at least 3 types of participants: GUI service providers, silicon vendors, and bare-metal system developers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md33"></a>
1.2.1 GUI Service Provider</h3>
<p >GUI service providers are the main beneficiaries of Arm-2D. Since Arm-2D provides a standard interface for hardware acceleration commonly required by GUI services, in their software package by default, GUI service providers only need to provide a porting version using Arm-2D as a low-level dependency, and it is sufficient to ensure that all Cortex-M processors are covered.</p>
<p >After saving a lot of unnecessary hardware adaptation work, GUI service providers can concentrate on improving the quality of their software services or provide high-value customisation services for their VIP customers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md34"></a>
1.2.2 Silicon Vendor</h3>
<p >Semiconductor manufacturers are the main beneficiaries of Arm-2D. As the market and users expect microcontrollers to use processors under the same architecture (to save their time of learning different processors), these semiconductor manufacturers often need to find ways to differentiate their products, hence introducing dedicated 2D graphic acceleration engine to their devices has become a new fashion.</p>
<p >While differentiation in hardware brings benefits to end-users, it also inevitably introduces the problem of software fragmentation. It is common in software engineering to introduce a unified API set, a.k.a. a hardware abstraction layer for fragmented hardware. Based on commonly agreed requirements among upper-level software, Arm-2D actually acts as an abstract layer for different 2D graphic acceleration engines. In this relationship, chip manufacturers only need to implement drivers for their own hardware accelerators following the Arm-2D standard, and it is (for most of the case) sufficient to see that most of the GUI stacks are ready for their devices.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md35"></a>
1.2.3 Bare-metal System Developers</h3>
<p >Most bare-metal developers often face a constraint embedded platform. A typical such system has less than 64KB FLASH and 4~32K SRAM. As a reference, a common low-cost serial LCD with 320*240 resolution and 16bit colour require 150KB RAM as just one frame of the display buffer. This is not a comparison of resources of the same order of magnitude at all.</p>
<p >For those deep embedded MCUs, most of the existing GUI stacks are too expensive to use. On the other hand, considering that the application scenarios are often very simple, i.e. GUIs' requirements are also simple, as a result, in many cases, even simple home-brew GUI-like data structures are good enough to meet the application requirements. In summary, most bare-metal developers will not choose the existing GUI stacks as the basis for their GUI-based applications.</p>
<p >When one has to build a GUI-based application from scratch with such resource-constrained microcontrollers, people usually either completely ignore the use of GUI or can only make necessary trade-offs among the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement GUI using only simple shapes, such as points, lines, colour blocks, etc.</li>
<li>Bearing with high transmission latency, read the pixel back from LCD's internal display buffer, perform certain calculations and write it back</li>
<li>Only copy/send pre-saved pictures in FLASH to LCD without further image processing.</li>
<li>Using a technique called the Partial-Frame-Buffer to practise time-space-exchanging</li>
</ul>
<p >In conclusion, <b>in the past, it was possible but not easy to implement a modern-looking graphical user interface in a bare-metal environment</b>.</p>
<p >Now, Arm-2D not only provides a series of easy to use function templates that help users to implement desired graphic effects but also supports the Partial-Frame-Buffer. It is worth mentioning that the <b>specific PFB paradigm introduced by Arm-2D is transparent to upper layer software</b>. This kind of transparency greatly simplifies the application development in a bare-metal environment, i.e. <b>users can write applications as if the device really has a complete display buffer.</b></p>
<p ><b>In summary, Arm-2D enable a large number of devices (that were traditionally not suitable for modern-looking GUI) to have a fancy GUI with a small memory footprint.</b></p>

1.3 Arm-2D Libraries</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md37"></a>
1.3.1 Standard Software Implementation</h3>
<p >As a starting point, Arm-2D provides a default software implementation for all algorithms. These software implementations are mainly written in the C language and occasionally include some local assembly acceleration. This ensures that Arm-2D can be used directly on all Cortex-M processors without modification.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md38"></a>
1.3.2 Helium Acceleration</h3>
<p >If you are using an Armv8.1-M processor, such as Cortex-M55, as long as you enable Helium support with compilation options, <b>Arm-2D library will automatically use Helium technology for acceleration</b>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md39"></a>
1.3.4 Third-party Implementation</h3>
<p >Arm-2D has provided standard ways to add support for various third-party hardware accelerators. Although not included now, In the future, we will introduce templates, examples and documents to show how to add support for third-party hardware accelerators.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md40"></a>
1.3.5 Arm Custom Instruction Support</h3>
<p >Arm-2D has provided standard ways to add support for 2D image processing algorithms accelerated with customised instructions. Although not included now, In the future, we will introduce templates, examples and documents to show how.</p>

This chapter will introduce some basic concepts and corresponding data structures that you must know to work with the Arm-2D library. Arm-2D systematically introduces a Boxing Model to provide more sophisticated and easy to use 2D graphics operations.</p>

2.2 Boxing Model</h2>
<p >The so-called Boxing Model describes the affiliation between Regions, which is often used to describe the relationship between containers and visual elements.</p>
<p >In a GUI stack, the Boxing Model usually talks about more complex stuff, such as the border's width, the margin inside a container border, the padding of / distance between the elements inside a container etc. Arm-2D does <em><b>NOT</b></em> cares about these details but only describes the simple relationship between a container and the elements inside.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md51"></a>
2.2.1 Absolute Location and Relative Location</h3>
<p >In Arm-2d, we consider panels or windows as containers, and the Locations of the panels and the windows are their coordinates in the display buffer. <b>We call this kind of location information that directly describes the coordinates in a display buffer as an Absolute Location</b>. In <b>Figure 2-3</b>, the panel (top container) coordinates are absolute coordinates.</p>
<p >The coordinates of the elements inside a container are described as <b>coordinates relative to the upper left corner of the parent container</b>. We call this kind of Locations the <b>Relative Locations</b>. In addition to that, since the container is only a special element, container nesting becomes possible. In <b>Figure 2-3</b>, the two innermost Regions have Relative Locations.</p>

2.2.2 Absolute Region and Relative Region</h3>
<p >If a Region has absolute Location, it is an <b>Absolute Region</b>; similarly, if a Region has relative Location, it is a <b>Relative Region</b>.</p>

<p >When we use these relative and absolute information to perform visual area calculations, it is easy to exclude those areas that are actually invisible to the user from various graphic operations, thereby improving the overall 2D processing performance (as shown in <b>Figure 2-4</b> ).</p>

2.3 Tile</h2>
<p >Tile is the smallest unit of various 2D operations in Arm-2D. The Tile data structure consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature of the Tile</li>
<li>Region of the Tile and</li>
<li>Pointers</li>

2.3.1 Root Tile</h3>
<p >A Root tile is a kind of tiles that directly contain the display buffer, and its feature bit <em><b>bIsRoot</b></em> is set, according to the pixel types used in the display buffer to which corresponding pointers should be used. For more details, please refer to <b>Table 2-1</b>.</p>
<p >It is worth emphasizing that for a root Tile, its Location coordinate must be <em><b>(0,0)</b></em>; otherwise, it is considered illegal.</p>
<p >With the help of <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html">C99 designator</a>, a tile structure can be initialised clearly and easily. The following example shows a root tile <em><b>c_tPictureCMSISLogo</b></em> representing a <em><b>RGBA8888</b></em> bitmap stored in a constant array called <em><b>c_bmpCMSISLogo[]</b></em>. Note that because the bitmap and the tile structure are designated as constants, it is highly likely that a compiler will use ROM rather than RAM to store them and keep a small RAM footprint.</p>

2.3.2 Child Tile</h3>
<p >Given any tile, we can derive a theoretically unlimited number of sub-tiles based on it, which are called Child Tiles in Arm-2D. It is worth emphasizing that the Tile that can be used to derive child tiles does not need to be a root Tile. The <em><b>bIsRoot</b></em> flag of the Child Tile is 0, which means that the pointer ptParent points to its parent Tile.</p>
<p >The Location information of the child tile is used to indicate its location in the parent tile. Negative numbers are allowed for the coordinates here. The region of a child tile can be larger than the size of the parent tile. This is often used to implement the Partial Frame-buffer. For more, please refer to <b>section 2.3.3</b>.</p>
<p >Figure 2-3 shows a series of Child Tiles, and their derivation relationship in the form of Region View.</p>
<p ><b>Figure 2-3 A Chain of Child Tiles and Their Root Tile</b></p>

<p >The introduction of Child Tiles can greatly simplify the storing and representing of GUI resources. Smart designers can even put many image elements in the same picture and retrieve them by creating Child Tiles with different sizes from different locations. In practice, A multi-level Child Tile suffers almost no performance loss in 2D operations.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md56"></a>
2.3.3 Partial Frame Buffer</h3>
<p >The so-called Partial Frame Buffer is a special use of the Tile Child scheme. It establishes a root Tile for a tiny rectangular display buffer and derives a Child Tile having the same size as the actual screen. In practice, the GUI software in the upper layer uses the Child Tile (with the full-screen size) to draw graphics and blend visual layers. After completing a frame, the PFB that actually saves the pixel information is sent to the LCD driver for a flush. Since FPB only covers a small area, the drawing process aforementioned, in most cases, will be judged as "no need for actual drawing" and skipped. To display the entire screen, we need to repeat this process continuously and adjust the relative Location between FPB and the Child Tile at the beginning of each iteration. For us, it looks like moving FPB line by line on the screen as shown in <b>Figure 2-4</b>.</p>
<p ><b>Figure 2-4 How Partial Frame Buffer Works</b></p>

2.4 Colour</h2>
<p >Arm-2D has reserved sufficient space for supporting more colour formats. A data structure has been introduced to describe a colour format used in a given tile. The C definition is shown below:</p>

2.4 API Usage Modes</h2>
<p >Arm-2D APIs can be used in both Synchronous mode and Asynchronous mode. In fact, The Arm-2D library is designed for working asynchronously, and wrappers are added to support synchronous mode.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md59"></a>
2.4.1 Synchronous Mode</h3>
<p >The Synchronous mode is also known as the classic mode, in which a function call won't return until the service is finished or an error occurred. In the current version of the Arm-2D library, all examples are written in Synchronous mode.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md60"></a>
2.4.2 Asynchronous Mode</h3>
<p >The Asynchronous mode is good for the event-driven design paradigm, and it is suitable for most of the RTOS based applications and applications that are written in protoThread and/or FSM in the bare-metal system.</p>
<p >The examples and documents for Asynchronous mode will be added soon.</p>
