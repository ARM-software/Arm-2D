## 1 How to get the Arm-2D

There are three methods to get Arm-2D:

-  Cloning Arm-2D repository on Github using the following command line:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/Arm-2D.git
  ```

- Downloading Arm-2D CMSIS-Pack from the [release page](https://github.com/ARM-software/Arm-2D/releases).

- Checking for Updates in pack-installer and installing the latest Arm-2D packs as shown in **Figure 1-1** and **Figure 1-2**

   **Figure 1-1 Check for Updates in Pack Installer**

## 2 How to Deploy Arm-2D

### 2.1 Deploy Using CMSIS-Pack in MDK

1. Open the Run-Time Environment configuration dialog using menu "Project->Manage->Run-Time Environment" as shown in **Figure 2-6**.

    **Figure 2-6 Open Run-Time Environment Dialog**
    ![](./pictures/HowToDeploy2_6.png)

2. Expand **Acceleration** and select **Core**, **Alpha-Blending** and **Transform** under **Arm-2D** as shown below. Make sure you also select **CMSIS-CORE** and **CMSIS-DSP**.

    **Figure 2-7 Select Arm-2D in RTE**
    ![](./pictures/HowToDeploy2_7.png) 
    
3. Enable **C11** and **GNU extension** support in C/C++(AC6) configurations:
   
    **Figure 2-3 Enable "gnu11" in Arm Compiler 6** 
    
    ![image-20210323171224685](./pictures/HowToDeploy2_3.png) 

4. Include the header file `arm_2d.h` in your source code where you want to use the library:

    ```c
    #include "arm_2d.h"
    ```

5. Initialize Arm-2D by calling function `arm_2d_init()` :

    ```c
    static void system_init(void)
    {
        ...
        arm_2d_init();
       ...
    }
    ```

6. Expand Acceleration in the project view and open `arm_2d_cfg.h` as shown in **Figure 2-8**. 

    **Figure 2-8 Find arm_2d_cfg.h in the project view**
    
    ![](./pictures/HowToDeploy2_8.png)  
    
    
    
    Open the **Configuration Wizard** and check options available for Arm-2D
    
    **Figure 2-9 Configuration Wizard for Arm-2D**
    
    ![ConfigurationWizardForArm-2D](./pictures/HowToDeploy2_9.png) 
    
    **NOTE**: If you want to support **CCCA8888** (i.e. **RGBA8888**), please selet the `Enable support for accessing individual colour channels`.



### 2.2 Deploy Using CMake

It is easy to deploying arm-2d as a library using CMake, for details, please check the [CMakeLists.txt](../CMakeLists.txt). 

### 2.3 Deploy Using Makefile

It is possible to deploy arm-2d using Makefile. We supposes you familiar with writing Makefile scripts and hence provide an [Makefile](../examples/[template][pc][vscode]/Makefile) used on PC as a good example. 



## 3 Helper Services and Extras

Suppose you want to develop GUI applications directly with Arm-2D. In that case, it implies that you not only use Arm-2D APIs for the framebuffer-based low-level 2D image processing but also want to display the processed result on a screen. An ordinary GUI software stack will provide a dedicated service for connecting a target screen, and users must implement a driver or adapter between the hardware and the service. Such a service usually allows people to refresh the whole screen with a petite frame buffer called partial frame buffer (PFB). This feature is vital for resource-constraint embedded platforms. Arm-2D provide a similar feature through a helper service called Display Adapter Service.

### 3.1 Preparation

Before we start, we have to prepare a low-level flushing function called Disp0_DrawBitmap(). Its prototype is shown below:

```c
int32_t Disp0_DrawBitmap(int16_t x, 
                        int16_t y, 
                        int16_t width, 
                        int16_t height, 
                        const uint8_t *bitmap);
```

Here as shown in **Figure 3-1**:

- `x`,`y` are the absolute coordinates in the target screen
- `width` and` height` describe the size of the rectangular target area
- `bitmap` points to a framebuffer which holds all pixels in a rectangular area with the given `width` and `height`. 



**Figure 3-1 The Scheme of the Low Level Flushing Interface**

<img src="./pictures/Disp0_DrawBitmap.png" alt="Disp0_DrawBitmap" style="zoom:70%;" /> 

Suppose the display RAM of your LCD has been mapped into internal 4G memory space. An example of `Disp0_DrawBitmap()` might look like this:

```c
/**
  \fn          int32_t Disp0_DrawBitmap (uint32_t x, uint32_t y, uint32_t width, uint32_t height, const uint8_t *bitmap)
  \brief       Draw bitmap (bitmap from BMP file without header)
  \param[in]   x      Start x position in pixels (0 = left corner)
  \param[in]   y      Start y position in pixels (0 = upper corner)
  \param[in]   width  Bitmap width in pixels
  \param[in]   height Bitmap height in pixels
  \param[in]   bitmap Bitmap data
  \returns
   - \b  0: function succeeded
   - \b -1: function failed
*/
int32_t Disp0_DrawBitmap (uint32_t x, uint32_t y, uint32_t width, uint32_t height, const uint8_t *bitmap) 
{

    volatile uint16_t *phwDes = disp_ram + y * GLCD_WIDTH + x;
    const uint16_t *phwSrc = (const uint16_t *)bitmap;
    for (int_fast16_t i = 0; i < height; i++) {
        memcpy ((uint16_t *)phwDes, phwSrc, width * 2);
        phwSrc += width;
        phwDes += GLCD_WIDTH;
    }

  return 0;
}
```

Here, `disp_ram` points to the memory space reserved for the LCD display RAM.

**IMPORTANT**: 

1. When exiting the `Disp0_DrawBitmap()`, Arm-2D assumes that the target frame buffer has already been flushed to the target screen. 
2. **Please verify the `Disp0_DrawBitmap()` functional correctness without Arm-2d before moving to the next steps.** 



### 3.2 Add Display Adapter Service

Deploying Display Adatper service in MDK is simple:

1. Open RTE dialog (as shown in **Figure 3-2**)
2. Expand `Acceleration::Arm-2D Helper`
3. Select the **PFB** and increase the number of **Display Adapter** to `1`. 
   **NOTE**: If you have multiple screens, please set the number accordingly. 

4. If you see any warning message in yellow, please click the Resolve button. The warning should disappear. 

5. Click **OK** button to close the RTE dialog. 



**Figure 3-2 Selecting Display Adapter Service in RTE**

![AddDisplayAdapter](./pictures/DisplayAdapter.png)

After that, you will see two files, i.e. `arm_2d_disp_adapter_0.c` and `arm_2d_disp_adapter_0.h` have been added to the project manager under the **Acceleration** group.

**IMPORTANT**: unless necessary, please do **NOT** modify the content of the `arm_2d_disp_adapter_0.c`, as new versions of Arm-2D often introduce new features to the Display Adatper Service, as long as you haven't modified anything in the `arm_2d_disp_adapter_0.c`, updating to the latest version would be an easy task nothing more than right-clicking the file in the project manager and updating to the latest version in the pop-up menu. 

**You have to initalise the Display Adapter service before using it**. 

Include `arm_2d_disp_adapters.h` in your c source code and add the following code to the `main()` function:

```c
#include "arm_2d_helper.h"
#include "arm_2d_disp_adapters.h"
#include "arm_2d_scenes.h"

#ifndef LCD_TARGET_FPS
#   define LCD_TARGET_FPS       30
#endif

int main (void) 
{
    ...
    arm_irq_safe {
        arm_2d_init();
    }
 
    /* initialize the display adapter 0 service */
    disp_adapter0_init();
    
    bool bRefreshLCD = false;
    while (1) {
        /* lock framerate */
        disp_adapter0_task(LCD_TARGET_FPS);
    }
}
```

Or the thread function if you want to run Arm-2d in an RTOS environment:

```c
#include "arm_2d_helper.h"
#include "arm_2d_disp_adapters.h"
#include "arm_2d_scenes.h"

#ifndef LCD_TARGET_FPS
#   define LCD_TARGET_FPS       30
#endif

__NO_RETURN
void app_2d_main_thread (void *argument) 
{
    arm_irq_safe {
        arm_2d_init();
    }
 
    /* initialize the display adapter 0 service */
    disp_adapter0_init();

    while(1) {
        //! retrieve the number of system ticks
        uint32_t wTick = osKernelGetTickCount();        
        while(arm_fsm_rt_cpl != disp_adapter0_task());
        
        //! lock frame rate
        osDelayUntil(wTick + (1000 / LCD_TARGET_FPS));
    }

    //osThreadExit();
}
```



### 3.3 Configure the Display Adapter Service

You should configure the Display Adapter service before using it. All the configurations of a Display Adapter service are stored in the corresponding header file, e.g. `arm_2d_disp_adapter_0.h`. In MDK, all configuration work can be done through the GUI wizard, as shown in **Figure 3-3**. 

**Figure 3-3 Configure the Display Adapter Using the Wizard**

![ConfigureTheDisplayAdapter](./pictures/ConfigureDisplayAdapter.png) 



There are many options available in the list, and we only explain those important and commonly used ones here:

**Table 3-1 The Important and Commonly Used Options of the Display Adapter Service**

| Options                                             | Value                    | Default         | Description                                                  |

You should disable it before the product releasing or disable it to add your own navigation layer. |



**NOTE**:

- If the target device cannot afford the full frame buffer, please set the PFB size (i.e. width and/or height) to a smaller value. **We recommend you start with a 1/10 full frame buffer**, as it actually isn't 10x slower than using a full frame buffer. 
- For **monochrome LCDs**, you should use 8-bit colour depth and pack every 8 pixels into one byte in the `Disp0_DrawBitmap()`. Don't forget to set the PFB alignment to 8 horizontally or vertically depending on the monochrome LCD pixel layout. 
- For **2-bit e-ink LCDs**, you should use 8-bit colour depth and pack every 4 pixels into one byte in the `Disp0_DrawBitmap()`. Don't forget to set the PFB alignment to 4 horizontally or vertically depending on the e-ink LCD pixel layout. 
- For **4-bit e-ink LCDs**, you should use 8-bit colour depth and pack every 2 pixels into one byte in the `Disp0_DrawBitmap()`. Don't forget to set the PFB alignment to 2 horizontally or vertically depending on the e-ink LCD pixel layout. 
- Please make sure the stack size is no less than 3K Bytes. 



### 3.4 Implement the External Reference Timer

Arm-2D helper service relies on an external reference timer which we should implement:

**Table 3-2 The Interface for Accessing the External Timer**

| Interface Prototype                                        | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| int64_t arm_2d_helper_get_system_timestamp(void)           | a function that returns the number of ticks (timestamp) of the reference timer since reset. |
| uint32_t arm_2d_helper_get_reference_clock_frequency(void) | the frequency of the reference timer.                        |



**We highly recommand you to install perf_counter from Pack-Installer, [Keil Website](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/) or [its Github repo](https://github.com/GorgonMeducer/perf_counter/releases) to simplify this process.** You have to initialize the perf_counter before using Arm-2D. For more, please read the [guidance here](https://github.com/GorgonMeducer/perf_counter/blob/main/README.md).



### 3.5 Verifying The Porting Result

After finished steps above, if everything goes well, you should see a screen as shown in **Figure 3-4**.  If the colour doesn't look right and the LCD uses RGB565, try to swap the high and low bytes for each pixel.  

**Figure 3-4 The Look of The Default Scene In A Successful Porting**

![](./pictures/DispAdapterDefaultScene.gif) 



If you encounter any problems, please feel free to raise an issue. 

Enjoy.



### 3.6 Asynchronous Flushing Mode

Different from the method described in **section 3.1** that lets the CPU flush the LCD directly, it is possible to use DMA (or peripherals with similar capability) to offload the processor - we call it **Asynchronous Flushing** mode, and the method described before is often referred as **Synchronous Flushing** mode. 

To enable Asynchronous Flushing:

1. Select `Enable the helper service for Asynchronous Flushing` in the Display Adapter configuration wizard, or equivalently define the macro `__DISPn_CFG_ENABLE_ASYNC_FLUSHING__` as `1` (here **n** represents the display adapter index number).
2. Implement the user defined function called `__disp_adapterN_request_async_flushing()`(here **N** represents the display adapter index number). The function prototype is shown as below:
```c
/*!
 * \brief It is an user implemented function that request an LCD flushing in 
 *        asynchronous manner. 
 * \note User MUST implement this function when 
 *       __DISP0_CFG_ENABLE_ASYNC_FLUSHING__ is set to '1'
 *
 * \param[in] pTarget an user specified object address
 * \param[in] bIsNewFrame whether this flushing request is the first iteration 
 *            of a new frame.
 * \param[in] iX the x coordinate of a flushing window in the target screen
 * \param[in] iY the y coordinate of a flushing window in the target screen
 * \param[in] iWidth the width of a flushing window
 * \param[in] iHeight the height of a flushing window
 * \param[in] pBuffer the frame buffer address
 */
extern void __disp_adapter0_request_async_flushing( 
    void *pTarget,
    bool bIsNewFrame,
    int16_t iX, 
    int16_t iY,
    int16_t iWidth,
    int16_t iHeight,
    const COLOUR_INT *pBuffer);
```
​	We use this function to send a DMA transaction request, and enable interrupt generation for this transaction.

3. In the DMA transaction complete interrupt service routine, call function `disp_adapterN_insert_async_flushing_complete_event_handler()` to report the event to the display adapter service (here **N** represents the display adapter index number).

```c
/*!
 * \brief the handler for the asynchronous flushing complete event.
 * \note When __DISP0_CFG_ENABLE_ASYNC_FLUSHING__ is set to '1', user 
 *       MUST call this function to notify the PFB helper that the previous
 *       asynchronous flushing is complete. 
 * \note When people using DMA+ISR to offload CPU, this fucntion is called in 
 *       the DMA transfer complete ISR.
 */
extern
void disp_adapter0_insert_async_flushing_complete_event_handler(void);
```

>  NOTE: If the device connects LCD via SPI, when using DMA for transaction, please handle the CS signal properly. Usually, we set the CS to low before sending the DMA transaction request in `__disp_adapterN_request_async_flushing()` and raise CS to high in the DMA transaction complete interrupt service routine (ISR).

4. In **Asynchronous Flushing** mode, it is better to increase the`PFB Block Count` to `2` (or even `3`) in the configuration wizard, or equivalently define the macro `__DISPn_CFG_PFB_HEAP_SIZE__` as `2` (or even `3`), here **n** represents the display adapter index number. A typical configuration is shown in **Figure 3-5**.



**Figure 3-5 A Typical Configuration for Enabling Asynchronous Flushing Mode in the Wizard.**

![image-20231120152652919](./pictures/EnableAsynchronosFlushingInWizard.png) 



It is worth to note that in Asynchronous Flushing mode, because the LCD Flushing parallels with the new FPB drawing:

- If the **actual LCD Latency** is equals to or smaller than the PFB drawing time, the **displayed LCD Latency** is `0ms`, otherwise
- The **displayed LCD latency** is equals to **the Actual LCD Latency minus the PFB Drawing time**, and usually very small. 




### 3.7 Direct Mode (3FB Mode)

To avoid the tearing effects, some devices provide a dedicated LCD controller peripheral, often known as **LTDC**. The LCD controller maps a **FULL framebuffer** as the display RAM and copies the content in the display RAM to the LCD in a fixed frequency. During this period, there is a time-window indicated by a signal often known as **TE** or **VSYNC**, as long as we can finish flushing the LCD in this time-window, the tearing problem can be avoided. 

Direct mode is such a mode that exchanges the FULL framebuffer as the display RAM on VSYNC or TE events. Arm-2D supports the Direct Mode through a dedicated helper service. 

To enable the 3FB helper service:

1. Select `Enable the helper service for 3FB (LCD Direct Mode)` in the Display Adapter Configuration Wizard, or equivalently define the macro `__DISPn_CFG_ENABLE_3FB_HELPER_SERVICE__` as `1` (here **n** represents the  display adapter index number).
2. Implement the following `uintptr_t` variables to indicate the address of three **FULL-Framebuffer**:

```c
    extern uintptr_t __DISP_ADAPTERn_3FB_FB0_ADDRESS__;
    extern uintptr_t __DISP_ADAPTERn_3FB_FB1_ADDRESS__;
    extern uintptr_t __DISP_ADAPTERn_3FB_FB2_ADDRESS__;
```

>  NOTE:  
>
> 1. Here **n** represents the display adapter index number.
> 2. The three variables should be initialized with the proper value before initialization of the corresponding display adapter service. 

3. In the **VSYN** or **TE** event handler, call function `disp_adapterN_3fb_get_flush_pointer()` to get a framebuffer pointer and use it to update the LTDC. (Here **N** represent the display adapter index number)



In fact, the Direct Mode can be used together with the Asynchronous Flushing mode. If the two modes are enabled at the same time, users have to implement the following functions:

```c
/*!
 * \brief An user implemented interface for DMA memory-to-memory copy.
 *        You should implement an ISR for copy-complete event and call
 *        disp_adapterN_insert_dma_copy_complete_event_handler() or
 *        arm_2d_helper_3fb_report_dma_copy_complete() to notify the 
 *        3FB (direct mode) helper service.
 * 
 * \param[in] ptThis the helper service control block
 * \param[in] pObj the address of the user object
 * \param[in] pnSource the source address of the memory block
 * \param[in] pnTarget the target address
 * \param[in] nDataItemCount the number of date items
 * \param[in] chDataItemSize the size of each data item 
 */
extern
void __disp_adapterN_request_dma_copy(  arm_2d_helper_3fb_t *ptThis,
                                        void *pObj,
                                        uintptr_t pnSource,
                                        uintptr_t pnTarget,
                                        uint32_t nDataItemCount,
                                        uint_fast8_t chDataItemSize);

/*!
 * \brief An user implemented interface for 2D-Copy.
 * \param[in] pnSource the source image address
 * \param[in] wSourceStride the stride of the source image
 * \param[in] pnTarget the address in the target framebuffer
 * \param[in] wTargetStride the stride of the target framebuffer

In DMA transaction complete event handler, please call the corresponding function to report the completion of the transaction:

 *       __DISPn_CFG_ENABLE_3FB_HELPER_SERVICE__ is set to '1', user 
 *       MUST call this function to notify the PFB helper that the previous
 *       asynchronouse 2d copy is complete. 
 * \note When people using DMA+ISR to offload CPU, this fucntion is called in 
 *       the DMA transfer complete ISR.
