### 1.1 Issues and Labels

Please feel free to raise an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ARM-software/Arm-2D/issues) to report misbehavior (i.e. bugs) or start discussions about enhancements. This is your best way to interact directly with the maintenance team and the community. We encourage you to append implementation suggestions as this helps to decrease the workload of the very limited maintenance team.

We will be monitoring and responding to issues as best we can. Please attempt to avoid filing duplicates of open or closed items when possible. In the spirit of openness we will be tagging issues with the following:
