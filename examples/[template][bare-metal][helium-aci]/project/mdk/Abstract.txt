The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ARM 'Cortex-M4' microcontroller using ARM 'V2M-MPS2' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  50 MHz
   - CCLK  =  25 MHz

 - Timer0 is used in interrupt mode
 - LEDs are blinking with speed depending on Timer0 interrupt period
 - colour GLCD display shows
   - init message
   - Button status
   - LED status
   - Touch status
 - 'Hello World' is output onto serial port USART0
   - USART0 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  Simulator:      configured for software Simulator

  FastModels:     configured for FastModels MPS2 Simulator
  
  V2M-MPS2:       configured for MPS2 (uses ULINK2 as debugger)

  V2M-MPS2 SWO:   configured for MPS2 (uses ULINK2 as debugger)
                  shows use of ITM output, Exception Trace

  V2M-MPS2 Trace: configured for MPS2 (uses ULINKpro as debugger)
                  shows use of 4bit Trace (use CoreSight 20 connector)
